These three factors are the constraints that project managers juggle to keep a project running as expected.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Scope (features, functionality) : The scope of the work refers to the project's deliverables or the result. It should be clearly defined and monitored throughout the project before beginning work. Scope creep, or the project getting bigger or changing without proper protocol, can throw the constraint triangle off balance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Time (schedule, deadlines) : Time is how long the project will take. It\u2019s important for project managers to make sure the team finishes the project before a deadline. A project manager must figure out how long a project will take and ensure enough people working on the job to complete it in time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cost (budget, resources) : The cost is the budget of the project. Clients and project managers agree on a budget before beginning the project, and keeping a project on budget will be one measure of success.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>Changing any one of the three will impact the others. This is a core concept, now often expanded to include other factors like quality, risk, and resources, but the triangle remains the foundational model.</p> <p>Some Resolutions for PM[^1]</p> <p>The following offers some everyday ways a project manager might adjust to keep the project on track.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Over budget:</p> <p>When a project goes over budget, it means spending more money than the client agreed. Since budget is the cost constraint, something else (scope or time) must change.</p> <ul> <li>If you reduce the scope (Shifting Scope), you deliver fewer features or smaller work, which also saves time and cost.</li> <li>Another option is to cut down the time needed by using fewer people or tools. In this case, the scope stays the same, but time and cost are adjusted.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Scope creep:</p> <p>Scope creep happens when the work expected in a project keeps increasing without following proper procedures (like formal change requests) i.e., when the expected deliverables grow larger and larger as the project progresses without following proper procedures, such as making change requests.</p> <p>When the scope expands, a project manager can adjust time and cost to compensate.</p> <p>If the scope expands, the project manager may:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Ask for more budget (to add people, tools, or resources) to finish on time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Or, if extra funding is not available, the project may need a longer schedule</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Over schedule :</p> <p>If a project runs behind schedule, the project manager has two main options (might shift costs or scope to finish the project on time):</p> <ul> <li> <p>Increase costs: hire more workers or buy better tools to speed things up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reduce scope: negotiate with the client to cut down the amount of work.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Triple constraints of project management</p> <p>Construction deadline</p> <p>A construction company is building a new office complex for a client. The client requested to move into the building a month earlier than originally scheduled. The project manager might accommodate this request by increasing the budget and bringing in a larger crew to finish the project faster. Or, they might prioritise certain areas of the building to finish early so the client can move in while construction continues, which would be an example of rearranging the scope to fit the new requirements.</p> <p>Solution Summary:</p> <ul> <li>Option 1: Increase budget \u2192 hire a larger crew to finish faster.</li> <li>Option 2: Adjust scope \u2192 complete only the most important areas first so the client can move in early.</li> </ul> <p>Marketing scope creep</p> <p>A marketing team is preparing a package of marketing materials for a client ahead of a new product launch. The client requests five additional pages of material. The client doesn\u2019t want to push back the product launch, so the time constraint has to remain the same. The project manager and the client will have to agree to either increase the budget and use more labour hours and resources or they will have to remove other materials to make room for the new additions.</p> <p>Solution Summary:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Option 1: Increase budget \u2192 hire more workers to complete everything.</p> </li> <li> <p>Option 2: Adjust scope \u2192 remove some content to make room for the new additions.</p> </li> </ul> <p>How to manage the triple constraint</p> <p>Use the following three tips to use the triple constraint triangle as a tool for success:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Understand non-negotiables: Some constraints will be more flexible than others, depending on the project and client. Find out which constraint (time, cost, or scope) is most important to the client. Example: if scope and time cannot change, budget must adjust.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be aware of other factors: Sometimes quality is also a key constraint in addition to scope, time, and cost. Be flexible and use a more adapted model of project constraints for whatever your project needs are.</p> </li> <li> <p>Communicate with stakeholders: Keep stakeholders updated, set expectations, and get agreement before making changes.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"unit1.html#13-software-development-lifecycle-sdlc","title":"1.3 Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):","text":"<p>A project lifecycle is the series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion.

This is a deliberate decision, not an oversight, as the team consciously accepts the potential consequences should the risk occur.</p> <p>Risk acceptance is typically used when the potential risk impact is low or the probability of the risk happening is low. It may also be used when there are no cost-effective alternative responses or if the project has sufficient contingency reserves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Monitor     Risk monitoring consists of continuously tracking identified risks and monitoring trigger conditions. It aims to answer questions like \u201chow has the risk changed, are there new risks that have emerged or are the risk mitigation plans working as expected?\u201d Large, complex projects benefit from risk monitoring or those with tight deadlines or budgets. It\u2019s also useful in projects utilizing new or unproven technologies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Buffer     This strategy revolves around adding extra resources, such as time or budget, to a project plan to absorb potential disruptions or negative impacts that a risk can cause. It creates a cushion that helps the project stay on scope, schedule and budget even if the risk materializes. This approach is especially useful when the project has a high degree of uncertainty or the impact of potential risks can be significant.

This strategy seeks to capture the benefit associated with a particular opportunity by ensuring that it definitely happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. Examples of exploiting responses may include assigning an organization's most talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion, or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration.</p> </li> <li> <p>Share</p> <p>Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it shares some of the benefit if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they are best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the opportunity. Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enhance</p> <p>The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or impact of an opportunity. Early enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the benefit after the opportunity has occurred. The probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it is not possible to increase probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors that drive the size of the potential benefit. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to an activity to finish early.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accept</p> <p>Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority opportunities, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address an opportunity in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs.

Quality is the degree to which a software product satisfies stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions. It is not merely the absence of defects but the presence of valuable characteristics.</p> <p>PMBOK Relation: This is the foundation of the Project Quality Management Knowledge Area. The PMBOK Guide defines quality as \"the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements.\" It emphasizes that project quality management aims to ensure both that the project fulfills its stated requirements (conformance to requirements) and that it meets the needs and expectations of its stakeholders (fitness for use).</p> <p>Quality in the context of project management refers to the degree in which a project fulfills its objectives and meets or exceeds the needs and expectations of its stakeholders.</p> <p>Why quality is of paramount importance ?</p> <ol> <li> <p>Quality directly impacts customer satisfaction.</p> <p>When a project delivers high quality results, it not only meets but often exceeds customer expectations. Satisfied customers are more likely to form long time partnerships with organizations, leading to repeat business and positive referrals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Effective quality management helps in cost control.</p> <p>By identifying and addressing quality issues early in the project life cycle, organizations can avoid costly rework and corrections. This results in reduced project costs and improved profitability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quality management plays a crucial role in risk mitigation.</p> <p>Identifying and addressing quality related risks and issues in a proactive manner prevents them from escalating into significant problems. This, in turn safeguards the project schedule, budget, and overall success.</p> </li> <li> <p>Organizations that consistently deliver high quality projects gain a competitive edge in the market.</p> <p>Quality becomes a differentiator that attracts discerning customers and sets the organization apart from competitors.</p> </li> </ol> <p>These principles serve as a framework for ensuring that quality is integrated into every aspect of project</p> <ol> <li> <p>Clear and well-defined quality.    Objectives are the foundation of effective project quality management. These objectives should be    specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound. They must align with the project's overall    goals and stakeholders expectations.Clear objectives provide a roadmap for quality planning,     execution and monitoring.</p> </li> <li> <p>The active involvement of stakeholders is instrumental in shaping the quality management process.    Stakeholders, including customers and users, project sponsors and team members have unique perspectives and expectations regarding quality. Engaging stakeholders and quality planning and decision making ensures that their requirements are considered, leading to greater satisfaction.</p> </li> <li> <p>One of the core principles of quality management is the emphasis on prevention over inspection.    Instead of relying solely on post production, inspection and corrective actions. Project quality management advocates for identifying and addressing issues at their root causes. This proactive approach not only reduces the likelihood of defects, but also minimizes the associated costs and disruptions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quality management is an iterative and continuous process.    Projects are dynamic and the business environment evolves over time. To remain competitive and meet changing expectations, organizations must embrace a culture of continuous improvement. This entails regularly reviewing and enhancing quality management processes and practices.</p> </li> </ol> <p>These best practices are a collection of proven methods and techniques that enhance the likelihood of achieving and maintaining high quality standards throughout the project's life cycle.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Quality planning</p> <ul> <li>The initial step in project quality management.</li> <li>It involves the development of a comprehensive quality management plan that outlines how quality will   be achieved and maintained throughout the project.</li> <li>The Quality Management Plan defines quality objectives, standards, processes, responsibilities and the methods for monitoring and controlling quality.</li> <li>It serves as a crucial reference document for the project team and stakeholders.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Quality assurance</p> <ul> <li>encompasses the processes and activities that ensure project work complies with the defined quality standards and requirements.</li> <li>It focuses on prevention, aiming to prevent defects and issues from occurring in the first place.</li> <li>Key components of quality assurance include process audits, peer reviews, and process improvements.</li> <li>It also involves the establishment of quality checkpoints and milestones to monitor progress.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Quality control</p> <ul> <li>is the ongoing process of monitoring and measuring project performance to identify variances from the quality plan.</li> <li>It involves inspection, testing and verification activities to ensure that the project's deliverables meets the specified quality criteria.</li> <li>When deviations from quality standards are identified, corrective actions are taken promptly to bring the project back on track.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Ensuring that team members possess the necessary skills and knowledge to meet quality standards is a critical aspect of project quality management. Continuous training and skill development programs should be in place to equip team members with the competencies required to deliver high quality work.     Training should cover both technical skills and soft skills such as communication and problem solving.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data and metrics play a pivotal role in quality management.     Project teams should collect and analyze relevant data to make informed decisions about quality.     By tracking performance metrics, organizations can identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.
