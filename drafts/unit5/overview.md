  Unit Introduction
  Unit V covers the critical phases where project plans are implemented and progress is systematically tracked. This unit bridges the gap between planning and delivery, focusing on the practical application of project management principles during the active stages of software development. Execution transforms plans into actionable work, while monitoring ensures the project stays on track through continuous measurement and control mechanisms.

The unit progresses through three essential components:

1. Project Execution (Section 5.1): The implementation phase where project plans are put into action, quality processes are enforced, and teams are actively managed and led toward project objectives.

2. Project Monitoring and Control (Section 5.2): The continuous process of tracking, reviewing, and regulating project progress and performance, managing changes, and addressing issues as they arise.

3. Earned Value Management (Section 5.3): A comprehensive methodology for integrating scope, schedule, and resource measurements to assess project performance and predict future outcomes.

The integration of these components ensures that projects are not only executed according to plan but also adapt to changes and challenges while maintaining alignment with project objectives.
