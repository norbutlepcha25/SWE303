5.3 Earned Value Management (EVM)
Earned Value Management is a methodology that integrates scope, schedule, and resource measurements to assess project performance and progress.

5.3.1 EVM Concepts and Metrics
5.3.1.1 Planned Value (PV), Earned Value (EV), and Actual Cost (AC)
Planned Value (PV): Authorized budget for work scheduled (also known as Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled - BCWS)

Earned Value (EV): Authorized budget for work performed (also known as Budgeted Cost of Work Performed - BCWP)

Actual Cost (AC): Actual costs incurred for work performed (also known as Actual Cost of Work Performed - ACWP)

PMBOK Reference: Process 7.4 - Control Costs

5.3.1.2 Schedule Variance (SV) and Cost Variance (CV)
Schedule Variance (SV): SV = EV - PV

SV > 0: Ahead of schedule

SV < 0: Behind schedule

Cost Variance (CV): CV = EV - AC

CV > 0: Under budget

CV < 0: Over budget

5.3.1.3 Performance Indices: Cost Performance Index (CPI) and Schedule Performance Index (SPI)
Cost Performance Index (CPI): CPI = EV / AC

CPI > 1.0: Under budget

CPI = 1.0: On budget

CPI < 1.0: Over budget

Schedule Performance Index (SPI): SPI = EV / PV

SPI > 1.0: Ahead of schedule

SPI = 1.0: On schedule

SPI < 1.0: Behind schedule

5.3.2 Calculating and Interpreting EVM Indicators
5.3.2.1 Cost Performance Index (CPI) Analysis
Trend Analysis: Monitoring CPI trends over time

Thresholds: Establishing acceptable CPI ranges

Corrective Actions: Implementing measures when CPI falls below thresholds

Forecasting: Using CPI to predict future cost performance

5.3.2.2 Schedule Performance Index (SPI) Analysis
Critical Path Consideration: SPI must be analyzed in context of critical path

Trend Monitoring: Tracking SPI trends throughout project

Recovery Planning: Developing plans to address schedule delays

Milestone Analysis: Comparing SPI at key milestones

5.3.2.3 To Complete Performance Index (TCPI)
Definition: The cost performance required for remaining work to meet specified financial goal

Formula: TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC) [to meet original budget]

Interpretation: Higher TCPI indicates more difficult recovery required

Management Use: Assessing feasibility of meeting budget targets

5.3.3 Using EVM for Project Forecasting
5.3.3.1 Estimate at Completion (EAC) Calculation
EAC = BAC / CPI: When current CPI is expected to continue

EAC = AC + (BAC - EV): When initial estimates were flawed

EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV) / (CPI × SPI)]: When both cost and schedule performance must be considered

Management Decision: Choosing appropriate formula based on project circumstances

5.3.3.2 Estimate to Complete (ETC) Calculation
ETC = EAC - AC: Remaining work based on revised estimate

Variance at Completion (VAC): VAC = BAC - EAC

Confidence Levels: Assessing probability of achieving EAC

5.3.3.3 Applying EVM in Agile Software Projects
Adapting EVM Concepts: Using story points instead of cost-based measurements

Earned Value in Agile: EV = Completed story points × budget per point

Agile Metrics: Burn charts, velocity, capacity utilization

Hybrid Approaches: Combining traditional EVM with agile metrics
