4.3 Risk Monitoring and Control
The ongoing process of tracking identified risks, monitoring residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project.

4.3.1 Implementing Risk Responses
4.3.1.1 Identifying Trigger Conditions and Warning Signs
Risk Triggers: Indications that a risk is about to occur or has occurred

Early Warning Indicators: Metrics and signs that provide advance notice

Examples: Team velocity dropping consistently, defect rates increasing, stakeholder attendance dropping in meetings

4.3.1.2 Integrating Risk Responses into Project Activities
Work Packages: Include risk response activities in WBS and schedule

Project Plan: Incorporate risk responses into overall project execution

Agile Integration: Include risk mitigation tasks in sprint backlogs

4.3.1.3 Measuring the Effectiveness of Risk Responses
Metrics: Reduction in probability/impact, cost of response vs. benefit

Monitoring: Regular review of risk response implementation and outcomes

Adjustment: Modify responses if not effective or if conditions change

4.3.2 Tracking Identified Risks
4.3.2.1 Conducting Risk Audits and Reassessments
Risk Audits: Examine effectiveness of risk management processes

Frequency: Regular intervals and at major milestones

Risk Reassessment: Periodic review of identified risks and identification of new ones

Agile Practice: Include risk review in sprint retrospectives

4.3.2.2 Using Risk Registers and Risk Burndown Charts
Risk Register: Living document containing all identified risks, analysis, and responses

Contents: Risk description, category, probability, impact, priority, response, owner, status

Risk Burndown Chart: Visual tracking of total project risk exposure over time

Tools: Integrated with project management software (Jira, MS Project)

4.3.2.3 Updating Risk Response Plans
Dynamic Process: Risk responses may need adjustment as project evolves

Triggers for Update: New information, changed conditions, ineffective responses

Change Control: Formal process for significant changes to risk responses

4.3.3 Identifying New Risks During Project Execution
4.3.3.1 Continuous Risk Identification Processes
Ongoing Activity: Risk identification throughout project lifecycle, not just at start

Techniques: Regular risk review meetings, lessons learned sessions

Integration: Part of status meetings and project reviews

4.3.3.2 Encouraging Team Members to Report Potential Risks
Culture of Openness: Psychological safety for reporting risks without blame

Processes: Easy reporting mechanisms, recognition for risk identification

Tools: Anonymous reporting options if needed

4.3.3.3 Analyzing Project Changes for New Risk Implications
Change Impact Analysis: Evaluate all changes for new risks

Integration: Include risk assessment in change control process

Examples: New requirements, technology changes, resource changes
