Unit Introduction
Unit IV addresses one of the most critical aspects of software project management: the systematic identification, analysis, and management of project risks. Risk management is not about eliminating all risks but about making informed decisions and proactively managing uncertainties that could impact project objectives. In software projects, where technological complexity, changing requirements, and resource dependencies are common, effective risk management often distinguishes successful projects from failed ones.

This unit progresses through three essential dimensions of risk management:

1. Risk Management Process (Section 4.1): The structured approach to managing risks throughout the project lifecycle, covering identification, analysis, response planning, and monitoring.

2. Common Risks in Software Projects (Section 4.2): Specific risk categories and examples that are particularly relevant to software development, including technical, schedule/budget, and human resource risks.

3. Risk Monitoring and Control (Section 4.3): The ongoing processes for tracking identified risks, monitoring residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project.

The integration of these components creates a proactive risk management framework that enables project teams to anticipate potential problems, implement preventive measures, and maintain project momentum despite uncertainties.
