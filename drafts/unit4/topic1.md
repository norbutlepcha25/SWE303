# 4.1 Risk management process

The risk management process provides a systematic approach for identifying, analyzing, and responding to project risks, following the framework established in PMBOK Guide.

> **Project risk may be defined as the chance of certain occurrences adversely affecting project objectives, the degree of exposure to negative events, and their probable consequences.**

Risk has two primary components for a given event[^1] :

    ● A probability of occurrence of that event
    ● Impact (or consequence) of the event occurring (amount at stake)

Risk management in software projects is the systematic approach of identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks to minimize their negative impact on project objectives. It ensures that uncertainties are proactively managed rather than reactively handled.

## 4.1.1 Risk identification techniques

## 4.1.1.1 Brainstorming and Delphi technique

Brainstorming:

Description: Structured group creativity technique to identify risks without initial criticism

Application: Team workshops with diverse stakeholders (developers, testers, business analysts)

Best Practice: Use facilitation techniques, time-box sessions, build on ideas

Delphi Technique:

Description: Anonymous, iterative process with experts to reach consensus

Application: For sensitive topics or when dealing with strong personalities

Process: Multiple questionnaire rounds with controlled feedback between rounds

PMBOK Reference: Process 11.2 - Identify Risks

## 4.1.1.2 SWOT analysis for risk identification

Components:

Strengths: Internal positive attributes (e.g., skilled team, proven technology)

Weaknesses: Internal negative attributes (e.g., lack of domain knowledge, tight budget)

Opportunities: External positive factors (e.g., new technology, market trends)

Threats: External negative factors (e.g., competitor actions, regulatory changes)

Application: Strategic risk identification at project initiation and major milestones

## 4.1.1.3 Creating a risk breakdown structure

Definition: Hierarchical representation of risks organized by categories

Structure: Similar to WBS but for risks

Typical Software RBS Categories:

Technical Risks

Management Risks

Organizational Risks

External Risks

Benefit: Ensures comprehensive risk identification across all project aspects

## 4.1.2 Qualitative and quantitative risk analysis

## 4.1.2.1 Probability and impact matrix

Purpose: Prioritize risks based on their probability and impact on project objectives

Scoring: Typically uses scales (1-5 or High/Medium/Low) for probability and impact

Risk Score: Probability × Impact

Color Coding: Red (High Risk), Yellow (Medium Risk), Green (Low Risk)

Application: Focus attention on high-priority risks (typically upper right quadrant)

## 4.1.2.2 Expected Monetary Value (EMV) analysis

Formula: EMV = Probability × Impact (in monetary terms)

Application: Quantitative analysis of risks with financial impacts

Example: "20% probability of a 2-week delay costing $50,000 → EMV = $10,000"

Use Case: Decision-making for risk response strategies and contingency budgeting

## 4.1.2.3 Decision tree analysis for risk evaluation

Description: Diagrammatic representation of decisions and their possible consequences

Components: Decision nodes, chance nodes, and end nodes with values

Application: Evaluating complex decisions under uncertainty

Software Example: Choosing between building vs. buying a component considering various risk scenarios

## 4.1.3 Risk response planning

Avoid: Eliminate the threat or protect from its impact (e.g., change technology, remove scope)

Transfer: Shift impact to third party (e.g., insurance, warranties, outsourcing)

Mitigate: Reduce probability or impact (e.g., prototyping, additional testing, training)

Accept: Acknowledge risk without proactive action (active vs. passive acceptance)

For Opportunities: Exploit, Share, Enhance, Accept

## 4.1.3.1 Risk response strategies: avoid, transfer, mitigate, accept

## 4.1.3.2 Developing contingency plans

Definition: Predefined actions to be taken if a risk occurs

Components: Trigger conditions, specific response actions, responsible parties

Contingency Reserves: Time and cost buffers for accepted risks

Fallback Plans: Alternative plans for when primary risk responses fail

## 4.1.3.3 Creating risk response ownership

Risk Owner: Individual responsible for monitoring risk triggers and implementing response plans

Accountability: Clear assignment in risk register

Authority: Risk owners must have authority to execute response plans when needed
