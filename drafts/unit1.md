### Part B: Descriptive / Case Study (10 marks each)

**Q1. Case Study on SDLC Models**
A government agency plans to develop a **tax filing system** with well-defined requirements and a fixed deadline.

- (a) Which SDLC model would you recommend? Justify.
- (b) Explain the **advantages and disadvantages** of your chosen model in this context.
- (c) How does the **triple constraint** influence your recommendation?

---

**Q2. Case Study on Agile Methodologies**
A startup is building a **mobile app** for delivery services. The requirements change frequently based on customer feedback. The team is small (6 developers), and they want **fast releases** with continuous improvement.

- (a) Which Agile methodology (Scrum, Kanban, or XP) would you recommend? Why?
- (b) Describe how the chosen methodology manages **scope, time, and cost**.
- (c) What roles and practices will be most useful in this scenario?

---

**Q3. Case Study on Project Management Methodologies**
A multinational software company is scaling up from one Agile team to multiple teams working on a **large enterprise ERP system**. They are facing coordination issues and delays.

- (a) Which **Agile scaling framework** (SAFe, LeSS, DAD) would be most suitable? Why?
- (b) Explain how its **principles or levels** help in solving coordination issues.
- (c) Discuss one possible **challenge** in adopting this framework and how the PM can address it.

# ‚úÖ Study Strategy

- Revise the **key takeaways** daily (triple constraint, PMBOK, SDLC models, Agile roles).
- Practice **Part A** short answers to strengthen theory recall.
- Practice **Part B** case studies to apply knowledge in exam-style scenarios.

## 1.2 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Models

### 1.2.1 Waterfall Model

- **Phases**: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment ‚Üí Maintenance.
- **Advantages**: Simple, structured, easy for stable requirements.
- **Disadvantages**: Inflexible, late testing, costly changes.
- **Best use**: Small projects, well-defined requirements, government/defense.

### 1.2.2 Iterative and Incremental Models

- **Spiral Model**:
- Phases: Planning ‚Üí Risk Analysis ‚Üí Engineering ‚Üí Evaluation.
- Risk-driven, good for complex/high-risk projects.
- **RUP (Rational Unified Process)**:
- Phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, Transition.
- Iterative & architecture-centric.
- **Advantages**: Early delivery of partial system, adapts to changes, feedback-driven.

### 1.2.3 Agile Methodologies

- **Scrum**:
- Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
- Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.
- Events: Sprint, Daily Scrum, Review, Retrospective.
- **Kanban**:
- Visual workflow (board with columns).
- Focus on limiting Work-In-Progress (WIP).
- Continuous delivery, flexible priorities.
- **Extreme Programming (XP)**:
- Values: Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, Courage, Respect.
- Practices: Pair programming, Test-driven development (TDD), Continuous integration, Small releases.

## 1.3 Project Management Methodologies

### 1.3.1 PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)

- **Overview**: Defines standard processes and knowledge areas.
- **Process Groups**:

1.  Initiating
2.  Planning
3.  Executing
4.  Monitoring & Controlling
5.  Closing

- **Tailoring for software projects**: Must adapt rigid PMBOK processes to dynamic/iterative nature of software.

### 1.3.2 Agile Project Management Frameworks

- **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)**:
- Levels: Team ‚Üí Program ‚Üí Portfolio ‚Üí Large Solution.
- Core values: Alignment, Built-in Quality, Transparency, Program Execution.
- **LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum)**:
- Principles: Transparency, Empirical Process, Whole-Product Focus.
- Rules: One Product Backlog, One Definition of Done, Single Sprint for all teams.
- **Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)**:
- Hybrid approach (Agile + Lean + DevOps).
- Phases: Inception ‚Üí Construction ‚Üí Transition.
- Decision points help teams choose best practices for their context.
