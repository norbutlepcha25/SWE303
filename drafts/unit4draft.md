## 4.1 Risk Identification Techniques

### 4.1.1 Brainstorming and Delphi Technique

- **Brainstorming**: A collaborative technique where the project team generates as many potential risks as possible without immediate criticism. Encourages creativity and broad participation.
- **Delphi Technique**: An expert-based approach where multiple rounds of anonymous questionnaires are distributed to experts. Feedback is refined until consensus is reached on the most critical risks.

### 4.1.1.2 SWOT Analysis for Risk Identification

- **Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (SWOT)** is used to analyze internal and external project factors.
  - _Weaknesses_ and _Threats_ often reveal potential risks (e.g., lack of technical expertise, competitive threats).

\### 4.1.1.3 Creating a Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)

- Hierarchical representation of risks, similar to a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
- Categorizes risks into levels: e.g., **Technical → Performance → Security**.
- Helps ensure no major risk category is overlooked.

## 4.1.2 Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Analysis

### 4.1.2.1 Probability and Impact Matrix

- A grid-based tool for ranking risks.
- Probability (likelihood of occurrence) × Impact (effect on project objectives).
- Helps prioritize risks into categories such as **High**, **Medium**, or **Low**.

### 4.1.2.2 Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Analysis

- Quantifies risk by calculating:  
  **EMV = Probability × Impact (in monetary terms)**.
- Example: If there is a 40% chance of a server failure costing $50,000 → EMV = $20,000.
- Useful for budgeting risk reserves.

### 4.1.2.3 Decision Tree Analysis for Risk Evaluation

- Graphical tool that maps decision alternatives and possible outcomes.
- Uses probabilities and EMV at each branch to identify the most cost-effective decision.
- Useful for high-stake, uncertain choices.
