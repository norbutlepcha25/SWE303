# 2.1 Project initiation

Project initiation constitutes the formal commencement of a new project, transitioning an idea into an authorized endeavor. This phase, as defined by the PMBOK Guide, involves developing the project charter and identifying stakeholders. It is critical for establishing the project's value proposition, securing authority for the project manager, and laying the foundation for all subsequent planning and execution.

## 2.1.1 Developing the project charter

The Project Charter is the document that formally authorizes a project's existence. It provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. It is the foundational document that links the project to the ongoing work of the organization.

## 2.1.1.1 Key components of a project charter

As per PMBOK standards and industry practice, a comprehensive project charter for a software project should include:

Project Title: A formal, descriptive name for the project.

Project Purpose/Justification: The business case, including the business need, problem statement, and high-level project description.

Measurable Project Objectives & Success Criteria: High-level project and product goals, defined using SMART criteria.

High-Level Requirements: The key capabilities, features, and functions the software must possess, derived from initial stakeholder input.

High-Level Risks: Identification of known significant risks, threats, and opportunities at the project's outset.

Summary Milestone Schedule: Key deliverables and their target completion dates.

Summary Budget: The pre-approved financial resources for the project.

Stakeholder List: Identification of key stakeholders, including the project sponsor, customers, and users.

Project Approval Requirements: The conditions that define project success and who has the authority to sign off on completion.

Assigned Project Manager & Authority Level: The name of the assigned project manager and their level of decision-making authority.

Name and Authority of the Sponsor: The person authorizing the charter and providing funding and resources.

## 2.1.1.2 Techniques for writing effective project objectives

Effective project objectives provide clear, unambiguous targets for the team. The primary technique is the SMART criteria:

Specific: The objective should be clear and unambiguous, targeting a specific area for improvement. It answers the what, why, and who.

Example: "Develop a new customer relationship management (CRM) module."

Measurable: The objective must be quantifiable. It should include metrics to track progress and determine completion.

Example: "...to handle 10,000 customer records and reduce manual data entry by 80%."

Achievable: The objective should be realistic and attainable given available resources and constraints.

Relevant: The objective must align with business goals and the broader organizational strategy.

Example: "...to support the sales team and increase lead conversion rates."

Time-bound: The objective must have a clear deadline or timeframe for completion.

Example: "...with the new module launched and fully operational by Q4 2024."

Final SMART Objective: "Develop a new CRM module to handle 10,000 customer records and reduce manual data entry by 80%, supporting the sales team to increase lead conversion rates, with a full launch by Q4 2024."

## 2.1.1.3 Gaining stakeholder approval for the charter

Securing formal sign-off is crucial for project legitimacy. The process involves:

Stakeholder Analysis: Identify all individuals with approval authority (typically the sponsor, key business owners, and senior management).

Draft Review and Collaboration: Circulate the draft charter for feedback, incorporating suggestions to build consensus and address concerns early.

Formal Charter Review Meeting: Present the final draft, walking stakeholders through each component, emphasizing the business value, risks, and commitments.

Formal Sign-off: Obtain physical or digital signatures from the project sponsor and other key approving stakeholders. This signed document becomes the formal agreement and provides the project manager with official authority.

## 2.1.2 Identifying stakeholders

Stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations that can affect, be affected by, or perceive themselves to be affected by a project's decision, activity, or outcome. Systematic identification and analysis are vital for managing expectations and ensuring engagement.

## 2.1.2.1 Stakeholder analysis techniques

Power/Interest Grid: This is the most common technique for prioritizing stakeholders.

High Power, High Interest (Manage Closely): Key players like the project sponsor and primary users. Engage closely and frequently.

High Power, Low Interest (Keep Satisfied): Senior management or regulatory bodies. Keep informed at a high level to ensure continued support.

Low Power, High Interest (Keep Informed): End-users or junior team members. Keep adequately informed to ensure their needs are met.

Low Power, Low Interest (Monitor): Require minimal effort, but re-assess periodically.

Stakeholder Cube: A more advanced model that adds a third dimension (such as attitude: promoter, neutral, blocker) to the power/interest grid for a more nuanced analysis.

Salience Model: Classifies stakeholders based on their power (ability to impose their will), legitimacy (appropriateness of their involvement), and urgency (need for immediate attention)

## 2.1.2.2 Creating a stakeholder register

The stakeholder register is the output of the identification process and contains all details about identified stakeholders. It is a living document that may be updated throughout the project.

Identification Information: Name, organizational position, role, and contact information.

Assessment Information: Main expectations, requirements, and potential influence on the project.

Stakeholder Classification: Internal/External, Supporter/Neutral/Blocker, or their classification from the Power/Interest Grid.

## 2.1.2.3 Developing a stakeholder engagement plan

This plan is a component of the overall project management plan and defines the strategies for engaging stakeholders based on their analysis.

Stakeholder: Listed from the stakeholder register.

Current Engagement Level: Categorized as Unaware, Resistant, Neutral, Supportive, or Leading.

Desired Engagement Level: The level of engagement required for project success.

Engagement Strategies & Actions: Specific actions planned to close the gap between current and desired engagement levels (e.g., one-on-one meetings, demo sessions, inclusion in change control boards, regular status reports).

## 2.1.3 Defining project objectives and success criteria

Clear objectives and success criteria are essential for establishing a shared understanding of what the project must achieve and how that achievement will be measured.

## 2.1.3.1 Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound objectives criteria for project objectives

As detailed in 2.1.1.2, the SMART framework ensures objectives are well-defined and actionable. It prevents vague goals and provides a clear benchmark for the team.

## 2.1.3.2 Establishing measurable success criteria adhering to SMART criteria

Success criteria are the specific, measurable standards by which the project's success is judged. They must be quantifiable and directly traceable to the project objectives.

Business Success Criteria: "Achieve a 15% increase in online sales within 3 months of launch."

Technical Success Criteria: "Achieve 99.95% application uptime and pass all performance load tests for 5,000 concurrent users."

Quality Success Criteria: "Achieve a defect density of less than 0.1 defects per thousand lines of code (KLOC) and a customer satisfaction score of 4.5/5 post-release."

Project Management Success Criteria: "Deliver all Phase 1 features, as per the signed scope statement, within the approved budget of $500,000 and by the scheduled launch date of October 31st."

## 2.1.3.3 Aligning objectives with organizational goals

Project objectives must contribute to higher-level strategic goals to ensure the project delivers genuine value.

Strategic Alignment: The project charter should explicitly state how the project supports the organization's strategic goals (e.g., "This project supports the corporate strategic goal of 'Digital Transformation and Market Expansion'").

Linking to Business Case: The objectives should be a direct reflection of the benefits outlined in the business case.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Project success criteria should be mapped to organizational KPIs to demonstrate clear contribution to business performance.
