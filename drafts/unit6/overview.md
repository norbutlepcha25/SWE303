  Unit Introduction
  Unit VI addresses the systematic processes and activities that ensure software projects deliver products meeting stakeholder requirements and quality expectations. Quality Management in software projects encompasses planning, assurance, and control activities that focus on both the product and the processes used to create it. Unlike other industries where quality is often inspected at the end, software quality must be built into the product throughout the development lifecycle.

This unit progresses through three critical dimensions of quality management:

1. Software Quality Concepts (Section 6.1): The foundational principles, models, and economic aspects of software quality, including international standards and cost implications.

2. Quality Planning (Section 6.2): The process of identifying relevant quality standards and determining how to satisfy them through comprehensive planning and process definition.

3. Quality Assurance and Control (Section 6.3): The application of planned systematic quality activities and testing strategies to ensure quality requirements are met and verified.

The integration of these components creates a holistic approach to quality that spans prevention, evaluation, and continuous improvement throughout the software development lifecycle.
