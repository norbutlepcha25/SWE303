<!-- Unit Introduction
Unit III addresses the core of project execution preparedness: comprehensive planning. This unit transforms the foundational elements from Unit II (scope and requirements) into actionable, detailed plans for time, cost, resources, and communication. Effective planning is what separates ad-hoc efforts from professionally managed software projects, providing the roadmap that guides the team from concept to delivery while establishing baselines for control.

The unit is structured around four interdependent knowledge areas that form the essential pillars of any project plan:

1. Time Management (Section 3.1): Translates scope into a realistic schedule by defining activities, estimating durations, sequencing work, and optimizing the timeline. This section answers "When will the work be completed?" and establishes the schedule baseline.

2. Cost Management (Section 3.2): Develops the project budget by estimating costs, aggregating them into a baseline, and establishing control mechanisms. This section answers "What will it cost?" and ensures financial accountability.

3. Resource Management (Section 3.3): Identifies, acquires, and manages the people, equipment, and tools needed to execute the project. This section answers "Who will do the work and with what?" and focuses on building and developing effective teams.

4. Communications Management (Section 3.4): Plans how information will be created, distributed, stored, and retrieved throughout the project. This section answers "How will we communicate?" and ensures stakeholder engagement through timely and relevant information.

The integration of these planning components creates a cohesive project management plan that serves as the primary guide for execution, monitoring, and control. Mastery of this unit enables project managers to create realistic, achievable plans that can be effectively managed throughout the project lifecycle. -->
