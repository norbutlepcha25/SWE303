# 3.2 Cost Management

Cost management includes the processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, funding, managing, and controlling costs.

## 3.2.1 Cost Estimation Techniques

### 3.2.1.1 Bottom-Up Estimating

Description: Estimating individual activities or work packages and aggregating to project total

Accuracy: High (most accurate technique)

Effort Required: High

When to Use: When detailed project information is available

### 3.2.1.2 Parametric Estimating

Software Examples:

Cost per function point

Cost per story point

Cost per line of code (less common now)

Accuracy: Medium to high

Requires: Reliable historical data and statistical relationships

### 3.2.1.3 Function Point Analysis for Software Projects

Definition: Standardized method to measure software functionality from user perspective

Components: Data functions (ILF, EIF) and transactional functions (EI, EO, EQ)

Benefits: Technology-independent, useful for outsourcing contracts

Tools: Automated function point counting software

## 3.2.2 Developing the Project Budget

### 3.2.2.1 Cost Aggregation Techniques

Process: Summing lower-level cost estimates to higher levels (work package to control account to project total)

Output: Project budget

Integration: Links with WBS and schedule

### 3.2.2.2 Establishing Cost Baselines

Definition: Time-phased budget used to measure and monitor cost performance

Components: Direct costs, indirect costs, capital vs. operational expenses

Approval: Requires sponsor/stakeholder approval

### 3.2.2.3 Reserve Analysis: Contingency and Management Reserves

Contingency Reserves: For "known-unknowns" - included in cost baseline

Management Reserves: For "unknown-unknowns" - not in cost baseline, requires management approval

Calculation Methods: Percentage of project cost, quantitative risk analysis

## 3.2.3 Cost Control Strategies

### 3.2.3.1 Earned Value Management (EVM) Basics

Key Metrics:

Planned Value (PV): Authorized budget for work scheduled

Earned Value (EV): Authorized budget for work performed

Actual Cost (AC): Actual cost incurred for work performed

PMBOK Reference: Process 7.4 - Control Costs

### 3.2.3.2 Cost Performance Index (CPI) Calculation and Interpretation

Formula: CPI = EV ÷ AC

Interpretation:

CPI > 1.0: Under budget

CPI = 1.0: On budget

CPI < 1.0: Over budget

Related Metric: Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = EV ÷ PV

### 3.2.3.3 Implementing Cost Control Measures

Regular Monitoring: Track EVM metrics weekly/bi-weekly

Variance Analysis: Investigate significant deviations (>10% typical threshold)

Corrective Actions: Resource reallocation, scope review, process improvement

Forecasting: Estimate at Completion (EAC) = BAC ÷ CPI
