# Project Initiation and Scope Defination

## **2.3.1 Scope Control and Change Management**

Scope control and change management ensure that a project stays aligned with its defined objectives despite **evolving requirements.** They involve monitoring project scope, **managing scope changes** systematically, and preventing uncontrolled scope creep.

!!! warning "Note"

    It's the project manager's job to ***limit the need for changes*** on one hand, and on the other to ***efficiently manage the changes*** in a way that the project could benefit.

Requirement change control is the formal process of handling modifications to agreed-upon requirements in a project. It ensures that changes are properly documented, evaluated, approved, and communicated, preventing uncontrolled scope creep and project disruptions.

## **2.3.2 Establishing a Change Control Board (CCB)**

- A **Change Control Board (CCB)** is a formal group responsible for reviewing, approving, or rejecting proposed changes to the project scope.
- **Members typically include**: project manager, client representatives, technical leads, quality assurance, and sometimes executive stakeholders.

- **Benefit**: Provides structured governance and prevents uncontrolled scope changes.

## **2.3.3 Evaluating the Impact of Scope Changes**

- Before approval, proposed changes must be evaluated for their **impact on project constraints**:

  - **Schedule** → Will the change delay delivery?
  - **Budget** → Will additional funds be required?
  - **Resources** → Are skilled staff/equipment available?
  - **Quality** → Will it compromise or enhance quality?
  - **Risk** → Does it introduce new risks or mitigate existing ones?
