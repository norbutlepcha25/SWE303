# Unit 5: Project Execution and Monitoring

## 5.1 Project Execution

> Project Execution is the phase where the project management plan is put into action to complete the work defined in the project scope. This phase involves ==**coordinating people and resources**==, ==**managing stakeholder expectations**==,==**ensuring Quality**==, and ==**integrating and performing project activities to produce deliverables**== in accordance with the project management plan.

---

## 5.1.1 Directing and Managing Project Work

> The process of **_leading and performing the work defined in the project management plan_** and **_implementing approved changes_** to achieve the project's objectives.

### 5.1.1.1 Implementing the Project Management Plan

The project management plan serves as the primary source document that guides project execution. Implementation requires translating strategic plans into actionable tasks.

**Key Components**:

1. Execute tasks according to scope, schedule, and cost baselines i.e, **_Implementation of scope management, schedule management and cost management_**.
2. Ensure all team members understand their roles and responsibilities i.e, .
3. Allocate resources effectively i.e, **_Resource Management Implementation_**.
4. Communicate expectations and progress clearly i.e, **_Communication Mangement implementation_**.

**As a PM, some of the things to remember**:

1. Ensure ==**_alignment between daily activities and strategic objectives_**==
2. Conduct regular project team meetings to review plan implementation
3. Use project management information systems (PMIS) to track progress
4. **_Document deviations from the plan_** and take corrective actions
5. Ensure all team members understand their roles in plan execution
6. **_Track resource utilization against the baseline_**
7. Collect and record lessons learned throughout execution

### 5.1.1.2 Managing Work Packages and Deliverables

Work packages are the lowest level of the WBS and represent discrete units of work that can be assigned, tracked, and completed. Effective management ensures deliverables meet quality standards and schedule requirements.

**Work Package Management**:

1. Assign responsibility for each work package i.e, Assign work packages to **qualified team members** with **ensured clearity and understanding of requirements** and **well defined acceptance criteria** with **established completion timelines**
2. Track progress and completion status.
3. Validate deliverables against acceptance criteria.
4. Submit completed deliverables for stakeholder approval.

**Deliverable Management**:

1. Define clear **acceptance criteria** for each deliverable
2. Conduct deliverable reviews and inspections i.e, Validate deliverables against acceptance criteria
3. Obtain formal acceptance from stakeholders
4. Document deliverable completion
5. Transfer deliverables to operations or next phase

### 5.1.1.3 Tracking and Reporting Project Progress

Systematic monitoring and communication of project status, performance, and forecasts to stakeholders. Essential for informed decision-making and maintaining stakeholder engagement.

**Progress Tracking Methods**:

| Schedule                                                    | Scope                                      | Cost                                                |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Track actual start and finish dates vs. planned dates       | Verify deliverables against scope baseline | Record actual costs incurred                        |
| Schedule Variance (SV) and Schedule Performance Index (SPI) | Track scope changes and their impact       | Cost Variance (CV) and Cost Performance Index (CPI) |
| Identify critical path changes                              | Monitor work completion percentage         | Track budget consumption rate (burn rate)           |
| Monitor milestone achievements                              | Assess deliverable quality                 | Monitor cost trends                                 |

!!! note "Key Metrics"

      - Planned Value (PV): Budgeted cost of work scheduled
      - Earned Value (EV): Budgeted cost of work performed
      - Actual Cost (AC): Actual cost of work performed

      Variance Analysis:

      - Schedule Variance (SV) = EV - PV
      - Cost Variance (CV) = EV - AC

      Performance Indices:

      - Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = EV / PV
      - Cost Performance Index (CPI) = EV / AC

      Forecasting:

      - Estimate at Completion (EAC) = BAC / CPI
      - Estimate to Complete (ETC) = EAC - AC
      - Variance at Completion (VAC) = BAC - EAC

**Reporting Structure**:

1.  **Status Reports**

    - **Content**: Current period accomplishments, upcoming activities, issues, risks
    - **Frequency**: Weekly or bi-weekly
    - **Audience**: Project team, sponsors, key stakeholders

2.  **Progress Reports**

    - **Content**: Cumulative progress, schedule/cost performance, trend analysis
    - **Frequency**: Monthly or at phase completion
    - **Audience**: Senior management, steering committee

3.  **Forecasting Reports**

    - **Content**: EAC, ETC, TCPI, completion date forecasts
    - **Frequency**: Monthly or when significant variances occur
    - **Audience**: Sponsors, financial stakeholders

## 5.1.2 Quality Assurance Activities

> Quality Assurance (QA) encompasses all planned and systematic activities implemented to ensure that the project will ==**satisfy relevant quality standards**==. It focuses on process improvement and preventing defects.

**QA vs QC Distinction**:

- **QA**: ==Process-oriented==, proactive, focuses on preventing defects
- **QC**: ==Product-oriented==, reactive, focuses on identifying defects

    - Ensures process compliance and identifies improvement areas.

2.  **External Audits**

    - Conducted by external agencies (e.g., ISO auditors, clients).
    - Verifies adherence to industry or contractual standards.
    - Often mandatory for regulatory compliance

**Audit Process**

1.  **Planning:**

    - Define scope, objectives, and audit schedule.
    - Select audit team and assign role
    - Review documentation and previous audit findings
    - Develop audit checklist and schedule
    - Notify stakeholders and auditees

### 5.1.2.3 Continuous Process Improvement in Software Development

> Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) is an **_ongoing effort to enhance_** software processes to achieve higher efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction.

**Common Methods**

1.  **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)**

    - Plan: Identify improvement opportunity and develop solution
    - Do: Implement the solution on a small scale
    - Check: Measure results and compare to expectations
    - Act: Standardize successful changes or try alternative solutions

2.  **Six Sigma**

    - Data-driven approach to eliminate defects
    - Uses DMAIC methodology (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)
    - Requires statistical analysis and rigorous measurement

3.  **Kaizen Philosophy**

    - Japanese approach emphasizing small, continuous improvements
    - Involves all team members in improvement activities
    - Focuses on eliminating waste and inefficiency
    - Encourages culture of continuous learning

**some practices For Continuous Improvement**

1. **Retrospectives**: To reflect on processes and identify what went well and what needs improvement
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate underlying causes of problems, not just symptoms
3. **Process Metrics and KPIs:** Measuring with respective metrics such as Velocity(Amount of work completed per iteration), Cycle time (Time from start to completion of work items), Etc
4. **Feedback Loops:** Collect feedback from customers, users, and stakeholders
5. **Knowledge Management:** Maintain documentation of lessons learned
6. **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks (testing, deployment, monitoring)
